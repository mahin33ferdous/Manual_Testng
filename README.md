Mindmap: Mind maps are generally used to organize information and make decisions. It is commonly used for checklists, Project Management, structured brainstorming, planning, etc.I have used mind maps to better understand the scope of applications and to quickly visualize the testing efforts required. It has been a simple way to share how software testing activities are going to be performed.
